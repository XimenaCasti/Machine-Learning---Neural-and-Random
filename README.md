project 4: credit card fraud machine learning

Title: Detecting fraudulent purchases through supervised machine learning

Intro: Fraudulent transactions pose a huge threat to financial institutions and everyday consumers alike. We aim to utilize supervised machine learning algorithms to identify high and low-risk factors associated with fraudulent purchases with the help of a simulated publicly available dataset.

Methodology: our approach involves the supervised training of several different algorithms in order to discern patterns and identify high and low risk factors. All pre-processingof the dataset will be done primarily with Pandas. Subsequently, we will utilize tools such as Matplotlib for general visualizations and Tableau for more in-depth visualizations such as geographic data.

Objective: Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent purchases based off of identified risk factors. With the help of advanced machine learningwe will be able to reduce financial losses and mitigate risks to consumers and business alike.
